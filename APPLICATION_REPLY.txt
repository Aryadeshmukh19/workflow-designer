Hello,

Please find my application for the Frontend Internship below.

GitHub project (workflow-designer): https://github.com/your-username/workflow-designer
Other repos / apps: (1) https://github.com/your-username/portfolio (2) https://github.com/your-username/todo-app
Short note on a tricky frontend bug I solved:
- Problem: A memory leak and duplicate event handlers when integrating a third-party canvas library.
- Fix: Used React Flow's internal event hooks, centralized subscription/unsubscription in useEffect cleanup, and debounced heavy handlers. Confirmed with React Profiler and removed duplicate re-renders.

Notes: The project includes bonus tech: TailwindCSS, Zustand for state, a small Node Express mock API, and a placeholder Rust validator in /rust-utils.

Best,
[Your Name]
